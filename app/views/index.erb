<h2>Welcome to Save Me A Plate!</h2>

<p>Did you know that roughly one third of the food produced in the world for human consumption every year
— approximately 1.3 billion tonnes — gets lost or wasted? Food losses amount to roughly
$680 billion in industrialized countries and $310 billion in developing countries.</p>
<p>This website aims to help reduce food waste by encouraging restaurants to share what food they have
remaining each day, and allows people to view those meals!</p>
<p>To get started, sign up! If you are representing a restaurant, please select the "restaurant" checkbox.
This will allow you to create and edit meals.</p>
